- Fortify Version: 1.3.1
- Laravel Version: 8.1.0
- PHP Version: 7.4.9
- Database Driver & Version: MySQL

### Description:
When running The laravel installer or jetstream install command, the CreateNewUser Fortify Action generated does not match the stub within the fortify project.

For example. within the fortify project the CreateNewUser Fortify Actio uses the proper `PasswordValidationRules` trait for the password validator. When that stub is published to my project, the CreateNewUser Action does not use the PasswordValidationRules trait and instead has ` 'password' => ['required', 'string', new Password, 'confirmed'],`

I've tried removing any composer cache but it continues to happen.

``

### Steps To Reproduce:
laravel new laravel8-jet --jet

Select inertia, and no teams

OR

laravel new laravel8-jet
composer require laravel/jetstream
php artisan jetstream:install

Now view the laravel8-jet/app/Actions/Fortify/CreateNewUser file and compare to the package's stub version.
